# KNN_IRIS_DATASET
 This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset. The model is evaluated through cross-validation, and different values of K are tested to optimize performance. Key steps include data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing the KNN classification process.
